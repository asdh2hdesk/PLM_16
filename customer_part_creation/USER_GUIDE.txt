## Overview
The Customer Part Creation module provides a comprehensive system for managing documents and drawings related to customer parts, with a strong focus on document control, revision tracking, and approval workflows. It is designed to help organizations maintain compliance with quality standards and streamline the lifecycle of technical documents.

## Key Features
- Document Control: Create, manage, and track documents and drawings for customer parts, including part numbers, descriptions, and customer-specific details.
- Revision Management: Maintain a complete history of document revisions, including revision numbers, descriptions, modification dates, and responsible users.
- Approval Workflow: Configure approval groups and manage multi-user approval processes before documents are released.
- Notifications: Automated email notifications are sent to relevant users when documents or revisions are released.
- Access Control: Fine-grained permissions for users, managers, approvers, and administrators to ensure secure document handling.

## Initial Setup
### 1. User Groups & Access
The module introduces several user roles:

- Document User: Can create and view their own documents and revisions.
- Document Manager: Can manage all documents and categories.
- Document Admin: Has full administrative rights, including undo and cancel actions.
- Document Approver: Can be assigned as an approver in the approval workflow.

Assign users to these groups as appropriate for your organization.

### 2. Approval Configuration
- Navigate to Approval Configuration from the main menu.
- Add or edit approval configurations to specify which users are designated as document approvers.
- These users will be required to approve documents before they can be released.

### 3. Document Categories
